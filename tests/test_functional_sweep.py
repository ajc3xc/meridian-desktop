"""Functional sweep: open every tab in the real window, check its buttons, and press only the Refresh buttons.

Offscreen Qt with fake data sources and a quiet Zotero client, so no test reaches the network, the keychain, Zotero or
the real home folder. The sweep is across tabs: each tab is shown in turn. It fails on a tab that does not build, on a
visible button with no label, on a Refresh button that never finishes, and on any exception raised while the sweep runs
(pytest-qt reports exceptions raised in slots and workers).

The GPUs tab reads this computer's GPUs and the RunPod pods when it is shown, by design. The Keys tab's RunPod card reads
the RunPod pods and offers when its own Refresh buttons are pressed. The conftest guard answers each of those reads with
a stub and records it. A sweep that shows those tabs must allow exactly those stubbed reads, so each tab's recorded reads
are checked against the set below, and anything outside the set still fails the test.
