"""Desktop update: a notice when a newer release is published, and the verified install kept for later.

Pure Python, no Qt import. Installing is off until release signing exists. There is no signing key and no signing
policy yet, so nothing the app downloads could be checked as genuine. check_for_update is the update check. It reads
only the latest release JSON from GitHub and returns one of four results:

    UpdateNotice(version, release_page_url)   a newer release is published. The user opens the release page.
    UpToDate                                  the latest release is not newer than the running app.
    Offline                                   GitHub could not be reached, or it is failing for now.
    Refused(reason)                           the reply could not be read, or it is not allowed.

check_for_update never requests a zip or SHA256SUMS asset, never downloads a file and never extracts anything. It
returns its result rather than raising it. Nothing on its path reaches check_and_stage or install_update.

check_and_stage and install_update are kept as code for when signing exists. When they run, nothing unverified is
ever run:

1. fetch_latest reads the latest release from GitHub. It needs two assets, MeridianDesktop-<version>.zip and
   SHA256SUMS, and the version must be plain dotted integers.
2. The zip is downloaded into a scratch folder. Its SHA-256 must match its line in SHA256SUMS, and it must be
   under MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES. A failure installs nothing.
3. install_update extracts the zip into versions/<version>.partial. Entries that are absolute, carry a drive or
   a stream name, contain "..", are symbolic links, or are junctions and other Windows reparse points are
   refused. A corrupt or encrypted member is refused too. MeridianDesktop.exe must be in the result.
   The folder is then renamed to versions/<version>, and the shortcuts are pointed at its exe.

Every request goes through an injectable transport, and urllib never follows a redirect. Each hop is checked
against the https host allowlist before it is requested. Tests pass a fake transport, so they make no network call.

Layout under install_root:

    versions/<version>/MeridianDesktop.exe   installed versions. The current and the previous one are kept.
    versions/<version>.partial               an extraction in progress. Removed on any failure.
    versions/rolled_back.json                the version rolled back from. Releases at or below it are held
                                             until a newer release is published. Cleared by that update.
