"""Hosted bearer token storage for the desktop. Pure Python: no Qt import.

The hosted Meridian bearer token (format in AGENTS.md) lives in the OS keychain and
never in settings.json. It is kept through secret_store, under service
``meridian-desktop``. One store holds every token the desktop keeps. Each token has its
own account name, so the hosted token and another token (a Google refresh token, for
example) share the store without sharing an entry.

Contract:
- get_token returns None when nothing is stored. It also returns None when the backend
  fails, so a failed read reads as "no token" and never raises.
- set_token and delete_token raise TokenStoreError when the backend fails. Nothing is
  silently dropped on a write.
- No function here writes a file. The token is in the keychain only.

Errors never carry a token value. The message names the operation and the error class.
Exceptions are not chained, so no traceback holds the value.
