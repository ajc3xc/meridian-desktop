"""Read-only reader for the Meridian project list. Pure Python: stdlib sqlite3 only, no Qt import.

The desktop shows projects from the Meridian database file, and this module only reads it.
Each call opens the file with the SQLite URI flag ``mode=ro``, runs one SELECT, and closes the
connection. The reader never calls the core ``init_db``, so it never creates tables, migrates a
schema, or creates a missing file.

Only the columns in PROJECT_COLUMNS are selected. The core table also holds executor_config and
agent_instructions. This reader never selects them, so they never reach a caller.

The list SQL is copied from ``list_projects`` in the core (meridian/db/__init__.py). The core
runs ``SELECT *``, so this reader names the eight columns it needs instead. The placeholder is
``?`` because the sqlite3 module takes qmark parameters.
