"""Owner-confirmed start, stop and status for the Meridian runner. Pure Python: no Qt import.

The contract is docs/local-trust-contract.md. The desktop builds the runner command in this module
and nowhere else, and the only commands it builds are these, run with shell=False and a list argv:

    <core python> -m meridian.local_runner start --scope <scope> -- <core python> <child arguments>
    <core python> -m meridian.local_runner stop --scope <scope>
    <core python> -m meridian.local_runner status --scope <scope>

- Subcommands: start, stop and status. Scopes: local and tunnel. Any other subcommand or scope is refused
  before a process starts (rule 3). Restart is not a subcommand here: the Qt layer runs stop, then start,
  and asks the owner before each one (rule 9).
- The local child is ``-m meridian``, the core's HTTP server. Without flags it serves 127.0.0.1:7878
  (meridian/__main__.py, and meridian/tray_main.py uses the same command). The tunnel child is
  ``-m meridian --tunnel``, the core's tunnel client (meridian/__main__.py). The child runs with the
  configured core python, not a bare ``python`` on PATH, as tray_main does with sys.executable.
- The core's ``status`` takes no ``--json`` flag. argparse rejects it with exit code 2. ``status`` always
  prints one JSON object, so this module calls ``status`` without one. Rule 3 names ``--json`` only
  "where it is used", and the core never uses it.
- Timeouts: start 30 seconds and stop 15 seconds (rule 5). Status gets 10 seconds, the same as the read
  client. A timeout is "not confirmed", and nothing is retried.
- Each start and stop attempt appends one line to the control log, in the settings folder (rule 6 and
  amendment E), whatever its outcome: confirmed, failed, not confirmed (a timeout included), already running,
  or not available (no core Python or folder set, or a process that cannot be started). Only a refused call,
  one whose subcommand or scope is not allowed, is not logged, because it starts no process. The line holds
  the time, the action, the scope, the outcome and the pid when the runner reports one. It never holds the
  runner's output, a token or a path. Status is a read, not an attempt, so it is not logged.
- A state is running only when the runner reports the child running. A missing, failed, unreadable or
  unknown state is unknown, and unknown is never shown as running (rule 7).
- The desktop never reads or logs a tunnel token (rule 8). It passes none, and it reads none from the environment.
