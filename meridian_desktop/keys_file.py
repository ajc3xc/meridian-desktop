"""Keys kept in a file the owner chooses, read as a list of names and as one value at a time. Pure Python: no Qt import.

The owner picks one of two kinds of file. The kind comes from the file name only, never from the content:

* a .json file: one JSON object of name to value text, for example {"OpenAI": "..."};
* a dotenv file: ``.env``, ``.env.*`` (for example ``.env.local``), ``*.env``, and secrets files (``*.secrets``,
  ``*.secret``, ``secrets.*``). Each line is ``NAME=value``. A line may start with ``export``, a value may be in single or
  double quotes, and a line that starts with ``#`` is a comment. An unquoted value runs to the end of its line or to a comment, which is a whitespace character and then ``#``. A ``#`` right after ``=`` is part of the value.
  Backslash escapes are not read. A value that spans lines is not read.

Any other name is refused. Only the file's path is kept in settings (``keys_file_path``). The values stay in the file:
they are never copied to the keychain or to settings, never sent anywhere except one Check request, and the app never
writes the file.

Listing reads the file to check every entry, and a bad entry is skipped, not the whole file. Listing keeps the names only.
A Check reads the one value it asks for, for that one call. A file that is missing, that is larger than 64 KB, that is
not UTF-8 text, that does not read as its kind, is refused whole, with a plain reason and
a count. Each refused entry is also listed with its place in the file (its entry number in a JSON file, its line number in
a dotenv file) and its plain reason. No value from the file is ever shown, and a refused entry's name is not shown either. An accepted
name is listed, and the names export writes it down, so keep secrets out of the name position. ``log_listing`` writes the same lines to the control log, one line for each refused entry, so the
owner can read them in the Logs page.
