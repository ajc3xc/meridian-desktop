"""Is the local tunnel running? The Home tunnel card's status line. Pure Python: no Qt import.

The tunnel runs as the runner's child process for the scope named ``tunnel``. The check is one
read-only runner call, ``status --scope tunnel``, made through runner_client.RunnerClient.status.
That client never passes a mutating verb. The child state in the reply becomes one of three words:

- running: the runner reports the tunnel process as running (verified alive right now);
- not running: the runner reports it as not started, stopped or crashed;
- unknown: everything else. A failed call, a missing runner, a reply that is not a status for the
  tunnel scope, a child state this module does not read, or a status call that raises. Unknown is
  never shown as running (local-trust contract, rule 7).

Each check result carries the time the check finished and one fixed sentence saying why. The
sentence never copies the runner's own output. This module starts nothing, stops nothing and holds
no secret. It also holds the words that name the tools which connect through the tunnel, and the
plain-words instructions for starting the tunnel by hand. The desktop starts and stops the tunnel only
from the Home tunnel card's buttons, after the owner confirms each one, and only when tunnel_control_enabled is
true (docs/local-trust-contract.md). This module itself still starts nothing.
