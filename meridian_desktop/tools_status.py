"""Which Meridian tools each AI client has set up, and whether the local server and the tunnel are live.
Pure Python: no Qt import.

The desktop runs no MCP server itself: the AI clients start them. So this module reads only what the
desktop can check, and starts or stops no tool:

- each client's Meridian entries, from the Meridian core's client setup plan (ClientSetupRunner.check).
  The plan is the only process this module runs. A wrapper around the injected runner refuses every
  argument list except the plan commands the core setup builds, so this read cannot apply or remove an entry.
- the local Meridian server: GET /health through local_client.probe_health, on a loopback address only.
- the tunnel: one status call through tunnel_status.read_tunnel_status.

The tunnel read goes through the core status command, which may record a recovered exit code in its own
state file, so this module never claims the read leaves no trace.

An AI client starts its own tools, so the desktop cannot see whether one of its entries is running. Those
rows say "Not checked" for live. Every row carries one plain sentence on what to do. No secret or token is
read or kept, and an exception's text is never shown, only its class name. The core's own error text is
never shown either, and a core checkout or Python path never reaches a row or the status line.
