"""Loopback client for the local Meridian server. Pure Python: stdlib urllib only, no Qt import.

Every request goes to an http URL whose host is 127.0.0.1, localhost or ::1
(assert_loopback). Each request has a deadline, set by its timeout over the whole
call, a fixed User-Agent and no credentials. Redirects are refused and not followed.
A response is capped at MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES, enforced before anything is parsed. A proxy
is never used, so loopback traffic stays on this machine.

The RunPod key never crosses this client. Meridian reads it from the keychain
itself, through its ``keyring:`` credential reference.

Errors carry a short code and fixed text. They never carry response body text.
