"""The launch-time starts in docs/local-trust-contract.md (amendments A, B and G). Pure Python: no Qt import.

Each start runs at most once, when the desktop launches, and only when its own setting is on:

- Zotero (amendment A): only when nothing answers on 127.0.0.1:23119, and only with the zotero.exe path the owner
  confirmed in Settings. It starts once, through zotero_client.start_zotero, which logs the attempt.
- The local server (amendment B): only when the core checkout and its Python were confirmed in Settings, nothing
  answers at the local URL, and the runner reports the local scope not running. It runs the fixed local start once,
  through runner_controls, which logs the attempt. The local URL check is an extra guard: the core's server stops any
  program already using its port before it starts, so a server the owner runs by hand must not be replaced.
- The hosted tunnel (amendment G): only in Hosted or Tunnel mode, only when the core checkout and its Python were
  confirmed in Settings, only while the tunnel buttons are on (tunnel_control_enabled), and only when the runner
  reports the tunnel scope not running. It runs the fixed tunnel start once, through runner_controls, which logs the
  attempt. The tunnel gives claude.ai access to the working folder, so the owner confirms the switch in a dialog that
  names it, and nothing else starts the tunnel by itself.

A switch that is on but has no confirmed value is skipped with a plain sentence, so the status line says why. No start
restarts anything, and an unknown state is never treated as not running. The caller supplies every outside call
through LaunchDeps, so the tests use fakes. Each step catches its own failure and reports it in plain words, with a
class name only when there is no fixed message.
