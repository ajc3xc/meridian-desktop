"""Bounded, redacted tail of the tunnel log, for the Logs tab. Pure Python: no Qt import.

The core writes tunnel diagnostics to one log file. Its path is the file named by the
MERIDIAN_TUNNEL_LOG environment variable (a file path), or ~/.meridian/tunnel.log when that
variable is unset or blank. This matches _tunnel_log_path in meridian/tunnel_client.py. When
the log is over 5 MB at tunnel start, the core moves it to tunnel.log.1 and starts a new log.

read_tunnel_log_tail reads the end of tunnel.log. When that is shorter than the budget, it also
reads the end of tunnel.log.1 to fill the rest. The budget is max_bytes (default 65536) in
total, counted in bytes read from disk. The older backup lines come first. A window that starts
in the middle of a line drops that partial first line, so no fragment is shown. Every returned
line then passes redact_line.

The module never creates, writes, truncates, renames or deletes a file. A missing log is not an
error: the result has status STATUS_NO_LOG_YET and no lines. A log that exists but cannot be
read gives STATUS_UNREADABLE, with fixed text and no exception.

Redaction is defense in depth. The core stops the secret reaching the file in the first place
(core-tunnel-log-tee-redaction). The pass here covers three shapes: a value after token= (in a
query string or anywhere else), the value after a Bearer header word, and a Meridian-kind sk_ token.
