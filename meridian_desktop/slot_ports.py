"""Listening check for the tunnel slot ports on this computer. Pure Python: no Qt import.

A slot is a fixed loopback port that one tunnel plugin rides on. SLOT_PORTS copies the
table from the core repository's meridian/tunnel_plugins.py (the DEFAULT_*_PORT values and
CUSTOM_SLOT_PORTS). The test pins the literal values, so a change in the core is copied here
on purpose and never picked up by accident. The word slot is retired in the core, and its
port stays in the table so the probe still reports on it.

The probe asks one question per port: does something accept a TCP connection on 127.0.0.1?
It opens a socket, calls connect with a 0.25 second timeout, and closes it. It sends no
bytes, reads nothing and makes no MCP request. Any process on the port would accept the
connection, so a result says "listening" and never "healthy". Health needs a request to the
server, which this module never sends.

The ports are checked one after another, so the worst case is len(SLOT_PORTS) times
PER_PORT_TIMEOUT: 3.5 seconds for the 14 ports. See worst_case_seconds.
