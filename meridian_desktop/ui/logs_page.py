"""Logs view under Settings, Diagnostics: a read-only look at the desktop, control, tunnel and runner logs.

This is Qt code and sits in ui/, so the boundary check allows it. The page reads nothing when it
is built or shown, starts no timer and polls nothing. It reads only when Refresh is pressed, and
the reads run on the thread pool, so the UI thread never blocks. The reads are:

- the desktop log: the bounded, redacted tail that desktop_log.read_desktop_log_tail returns;
- the control log: the bounded, redacted tail that runner_controls.read_control_log_tail returns, one line per Start or Stop;
- the tunnel log: the bounded, redacted tail that log_tail.read_tunnel_log_tail returns;
- the runner log: the tail-log reply of the runner client. runner_client passes only the read
  verbs, so no mutating verb is ever run from this page.

Every line of every pane goes through desktop_log.redact_text, so no source can show a raw secret.

The page has one button, Refresh. It has no clear, delete, rotate or truncate control, and it never
writes to any log. Every pane is read-only plain text (QPlainTextEdit with setPlainText), and every
label is PlainText, so a log line is never read as HTML. Labels and panes can be selected to copy.

When a log is missing or empty, its pane says which process writes it and what to run to produce
it. The desktop has no setting for the core's interpreter or runner scope, so the runner pane says
the desktop cannot read the runner from here, and it says to press Refresh again or check Settings. It starts
no process.
