"""The Settings tab: seven collapsible groups in one scrolling column, in this order.

1. Connection: the mode (shown, set by the top-bar selector), the hosted URL, the hosted sign-in (Sign in with browser
   and Sign out), the Test connection and Try again buttons, the local URL and the database file.
2. Local server and startup: the runner block (ui/runner_section.py), its state and Start, Stop and Restart, the two
   launch-time switches, and the automatic update checkbox. Each control asks the owner first, except the update checkbox.
3. Client setup: the Meridian core checkout and its Python, then one row per client (ui/client_setup_section.py).
4. MCP tools: one folding group per tool group, with a switch for each tool and for each group (ui/tools_section.py).
   Every tool is on by default. The choice is saved in the settings file and applied at the next start.
5. Connections: the owner's own MCP connectors, each with an on switch, a tunnel switch and Remove, and a form that adds one
   (ui/connections_section.py). Written to Claude Desktop and Codex at the next start. Nothing reaches claude.ai from here.
6. GPU hosts over SSH: the SSH host names the GPUs tab reads. Only names are saved.
7. Diagnostics (logs): the settings file path, any note from loading it, and the Logs view (ui/logs_page.py).
   It starts folded. The Logs view reads nothing until its Refresh is pressed.

The keys are not here. The Keys tab (ui/keys_tab.py) is a tab of its own: the RunPod entry card and one card per named key.

The hosted URL is checked with hosted_client.validate_base_url before anything is written. Sign in with browser runs the
server's device flow (hosted_session.sign_in) on a worker thread: it shows the sign-in code, opens the browser, and saves
the token to the keychain through token_store when the owner approves. No token is typed or pasted. The tab shows only
whether a token is set. Sign out removes the token and the saved session. Test connection makes one GET /projects with
the saved URL and token, on a worker thread, and shows the result in plain words. Try again runs the same test, from
the button beside it.

The local URL is checked with local_client.assert_loopback before anything is written. A value that is not an http
loopback URL is refused inline, and the settings file is not touched. The database file is picked with a file dialog, and
only its path is saved.

The mode is shown, not edited. The top-bar selector is the one control that changes it, and the main window calls
refresh() after each save, so both always show the same saved mode.
