"""The Keys block on the Keys tab (ui/keys_tab.py): RunPod, a search box, one card per saved name, a keys file control, and an
add form. Qt code.

The RunPod entry is the RunPod panel's own card (ui/runpod_panel.py), so its checks, its pod list and its key row work as
they did before. Every other name is a card of its own: its status, a password box for a new value, Save value and Remove.
A name is added with the form at the foot of the block. The search box above the list shows only the cards whose name
contains its text, ignoring case. It searches names only, never values or statuses.

Each card, RunPod's included, has a Mark critical box and a Set as Windows user variable button. A critical name is listed
first and shows a Critical badge. The mark is saved in settings by name. Setting a user variable asks first, and then writes
the saved value to the Windows user environment.

Values go to the keychain through api_keys. This block never shows a value, never reads one back into a control, and never
writes one to the settings file. A status is read only to test whether a value is set. A failed read shows as unreadable.
Remove asks first, because the saved value is deleted from the keychain.

A keys file the owner chose lists more names (keys_file.py). Each one is a card marked From file, with no value box: its
value stays in the file and is read only when its Check is pressed. The app never writes the file. Remove on such a name
only takes it off the list for this session, and says the file is unchanged. A name that the keychain also holds shows
once, as the keychain name.

A name that matches a known service (key_services) also shows what its key is for and where it is made. When that
service has a check, its card has a Check button. The check runs only when the owner presses it, on the thread pool,
and shows one fixed message. The form can pick a service, which fills in the name. Other leaves the name as typed.
