"""Main window: a connection bar, a mode selector, then eight tabs: Home, Projects, Sessions, GPUs, Search, Tunnel, Keys, Settings.

The connection bar (ui/connection_bar.py) is the strip at the very top. It states who is signed in and until when, what
the desktop is connected to (the hosted URL, with connected, reconnecting or not connected), and the local server when
one is live. It checks when the window opens, every five minutes, and after a sign-in or sign-out. With no token saved
it makes no hosted call. With one saved, it calls GET /me on the hosted URL, and it renews the token only when a refresh
token was saved and under 14 days remain. Sign in with browser in Settings calls the hosted device flow only when the
owner presses it.

Home (ui/home_tab.py) has one card for each part of Meridian: the local Meridian server, the tunnel, the services
(the LaTeX engine and the slot ports), Zotero, the AI clients and their tools, and the updates. Each card checks its
part on its own when the window first shows, again every five minutes while Home is showing, and when Check now is
pressed. The tunnel's Start, Stop and Restart are in the Tunnel panel in Settings, and each asks first. The Zotero launch
asks first too. Search (ui/search_tab.py) lists the local server's code, outputs and research, grouped by source. It has no
search box. Code and outputs have no list route yet, so they send nothing, and research runs are read from the Local URL.
The Tunnel tab (ui/tunnel_panel.py) is the one place for the tunnel: its status, Start, Stop and
Restart, the lanes, the tool groups and the custom connectors. The Keys tab (ui/keys_tab.py) holds the RunPod card and
one card per named key. Settings then holds the connection settings, the Zotero library panel, the Writing area (DOCX
and Slides, each Not connected), and
Diagnostics: the full tools table, the LaTeX engine probe, and the desktop, tunnel and runner logs. The Projects and
Sessions tabs are read-only.

Qt code lives in meridian_desktop/ui/ (and the listed exception tray.py). Settings go through settings_store and the
RunPod key goes through secret_store, and neither imports Qt. The only network calls, apart from the update check
below and the hosted calls of the connection bar and Sign in with browser (described at the top), are loopback calls: to the local Meridian server at the local_url setting, to the local LaTeX engine at the
engine_url setting, to the local Zotero API on 127.0.0.1:23119, and to 127.0.0.1 slot ports for a connect-only check.
A check makes its call when the window first shows, on the Home tab's five-minute timer while it is showing, or when
its button is pressed. The Search tab reads the research runs when it is first shown and when Refresh is pressed. Hosted mode calls
only the hosted URL the owner sets: on the Projects tab, on the Sessions tab when it is first shown or its Refresh is
pressed (for the project list, and for the sessions when no local server answers and a hosted token is saved), and
on the Test connection and Try again buttons in Settings.

The Sessions tab (read-only) lists the sessions of one project, picked from the project list. The project list
and the sessions are read when the tab is first shown and when its Refresh button is pressed, through the mode
chosen in the mode selector. While the tab stays visible, a 5-second timer reads only the local server, and only
in local mode, for the picked project. The timer never reads the project list and never calls the hosted host,
and when the local server does not answer it changes nothing on screen. Changing the picked project reads the
local server the same way, in local mode only; in any other mode it clears the table and says to press Refresh.

At a real start, one update check runs on the thread pool, and again every six hours while the app runs. It asks GitHub
for the latest release and its signed checksum list, downloads a newer release only after the signature verifies, and
stages it for the next restart. The status bar shows the download and the staged release, and the Updates card on Home
reads that same one result without asking GitHub again. It is off when the auto_update or check_updates setting is
false, and the app passes no transport under --smoke, so a smoke run makes no request.

Tunnel mode reads projects the same way Hosted does. Its top bar shows one line with the tunnel's
state (from one read-only status call, made when the mode is switched to Tunnel and at start in
Tunnel mode), the tools that need the tunnel, and how to start it by hand. The top bar has no
control that starts, stops or restarts anything.
