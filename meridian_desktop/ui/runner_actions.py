"""The Qt side of the owner-confirmed runner controls: the confirmation dialog, the off-thread job, the launch-time starts.

This is Qt code, so it sits in ui/. Its pure parts are in meridian_desktop/runner_controls.py and
meridian_desktop/launch_starts.py, and the contract is docs/local-trust-contract.md.

- RunnerActions holds every outside effect the controls use: the saved core setup, the RunnerControl factory, the
  confirmation dialog, and the Zotero and local-URL calls. The app builds it from the settings file. Tests pass fakes.
- ask_control builds the confirmation dialog. Its default button is Cancel, Escape is Cancel, and it names the exact
  command, the scope and the working folder. Only the confirm button returns True (rule 2).
- submit runs one call on the thread pool. Its result comes back through shared_delivery() with the owner token and
  a generation number. The job never holds a widget, so a widget that is deleted while a call runs is never touched.
- LaunchStarts runs the two launch-time starts (amendments A and B) once, after the window shows, through the same
  delivery path. It starts nothing when both settings are off.
