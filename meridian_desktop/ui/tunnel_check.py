"""The tunnel check job for the top bar. Qt code, so it sits in ui/.

The main window runs one read-only tunnel status call on the thread pool each time Tunnel mode is chosen, and
this job carries it there. The Home tunnel card runs its own read through the same status call. The Tunnel panel
uses TunnelReadJob, which runs the same status call and then reads the tail of the tunnel log. Nothing here starts,
stops or restarts the tunnel.
