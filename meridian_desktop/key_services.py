"""Known services for the named API keys: what each key is for, where it is made, and an optional check.

Pure Python: stdlib urllib only, no Qt import.

A registry entry names a service, says in one line what its key is for, and says where the key is made. The page is
plain text, shown as written. Nothing is fetched to build it.

A service may carry a check: one GET to that provider's own https host, which shows whether the saved key is accepted.
The check runs only when the owner presses Check on a key row. It reads the key for that one request, from the keychain
or from the keys file the owner chose (keys_file.py), sends it to the provider host and nowhere else, and reports one of
the fixed messages below. The key is never returned,
stored past the call, or put in a message. A failure is reported by its kind alone, and no exception is chained, so no
traceback holds the request headers.

The transport is injectable. It takes the request and a timeout in seconds, and returns the HTTP status. Tests pass a
fake, so they never reach the network. The default transport is urllib, with no redirects followed.
