"""The names-only export of the Keys block: one JSON file that lists each key name and its classification, and no value.

The file is EXPORT_NAME (meridian-keys-backup.json) in the backups folder beside settings.json, the same folder that
projects_backup uses. It holds the names the Keys block lists: the keychain names, then the names from the keys file the
owner chose that the keychain does not also hold. Each row has the name, its source and its classification
(keys_file.is_classified). No value is read or written here, so a value cannot reach the file.

The write goes to a temp file first and then replaces the earlier export, so a failed or interrupted write never leaves a
half-written export behind. Pure Python: no Qt import.
