"""Choose the data source for the Projects view. Pure Python: no Qt import.

``resolve`` reads the mode from Settings and returns one source, never two.

Local mode:
- the local Meridian server, when its probe state is running: source "server".
- otherwise the database file, when db_path names an existing file: source "file".
- otherwise state "no_local_data", with a message and no rows.

Hosted mode:
- no stored token: state "not_signed_in". Nothing is probed, read or fetched.
- a stored token: the rows from the hosted client, source "hosted".

Tunnel mode reads exactly as hosted mode does. Hosted tools reach this computer through the
tunnel, so the projects come from the same hosted client with the same token. The tunnel's
state is shown on the top bar, not checked here, and a stopped tunnel does not change what is read.

This module makes no network call and reads no file itself. Each outside effect is an
injected callable in DataSources. The app passes the real functions (local_client.probe_health,
a server reader, projects_reader.list_projects, token_store.get_token and hosted_client.list_projects),
and tests pass fakes. The token goes only to the hosted client. It never appears in a
Resolution, a message or an error.

A failed read gives state "read_failed", with the chosen source and no rows. A HostedError
(from hosted_client) gives its own fixed text, which holds no token, body or path. Any other
exception is named by its class only, never a path, a token or a response body.
