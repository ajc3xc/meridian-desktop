"""Hosted Meridian client: GET /projects with a bearer token. Pure Python: stdlib urllib only, no Qt import.

``list_projects`` sends one GET to {hosted URL}/projects with ``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` and
returns the parsed JSON list. The caller reads the token from the keychain and passes it in. This
module never stores the token and never writes it to a file.

Refused before any request is made:
- a base URL that is not https, unless its host is 127.0.0.1, localhost or ::1 (http is allowed there);
- a base URL that holds a user name, a password, a query or a fragment;
- an empty token, or a token with a space, a control character or non-ASCII text.

Each request has a 10 second timeout and no retries. Redirects are not followed, so a 3xx reply is an
error and the bearer token never goes to a second host. A response is capped at MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES,
checked before anything is parsed.

Errors are typed. Each message is fixed text, with no token, no response body and no raw exception.
A transport failure is reported by its kind alone, and the exception is not chained, so no traceback
holds the request headers.

The transport is injectable. The default one is urllib. Tests pass a fake, so they need no network.
