"""Backup of the hosted projects to this computer. Pure Python: no Qt import.

A backup is one JSON file, ``projects-<UTC time>Z.json``, in the ``backups`` folder beside settings.json: that is
%LOCALAPPDATA%\\meridian-desktop\\backups, or ~/.meridian-desktop/backups when LOCALAPPDATA is unset. It holds only each
project's id, name and created_at, and the time it was taken. It never holds the token, the hosted URL, or any other
field of the hosted reply.

backup_hosted is the one write, and it runs in one pass. It reads the whole hosted project list through the list
function it is given (the app passes the hosted client's GET /projects), and writes one file that holds every project
in that list. A failed read writes nothing, so a failure never removes a backup. A read that gives no usable project
(an empty list, or no row with an id) writes nothing either, and raises NoUsableProjects: an empty answer never stands
in for a backup that holds projects. After a successful write the newest BACKUPS_KEPT backup files are kept, and so is
the newest backup that holds projects, even when newer files hold none (prune_backups). Older backup files are removed.

Nothing in this module sends anything to the hosted service, and nothing reads a backup back.
