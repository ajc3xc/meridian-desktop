"""The Home tab's card texts, in plain words. Pure Python: no Qt import.

Each card's check runs off the UI thread and hands back a plain result: the local server's facts, the services
facts, a tunnel status, a Zotero status, a tools status or an update check. This module turns one result into a
CardView: a headline, one detail sentence, the time checked, the rows of a compact list, and at most one action.

Nothing here starts, stops or installs anything. Only fixed words and the module's own sentences reach a view, so no
exception text, traceback, path or secret is shown. A card that cannot check says why and what to do, in one sentence.
