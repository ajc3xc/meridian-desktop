"""Read-only client for the sessions of one project. Pure Python: no Qt import.

The route is GET /projects/{project_id}/sessions?active_only=true on the Meridian server (core repo,
meridian/routes/projects.py). It answers with a JSON list of session rows, newest first. With
active_only=true only active and idle sessions come back.

Two sources, one result type:

- local_sessions: the local server at local_url. Loopback only (local_client.assert_loopback). No
  credentials are sent. It keeps the local client's limits: no proxy, no redirects, a size cap, a deadline.
- hosted_sessions: hosted Meridian at hosted_url, with ``Authorization: Bearer <token>``. The URL must be
  https. Plain http is refused even on loopback, so the token never travels in clear text. The token goes
  only to that host. It is never placed in a result, a message or an error. The request uses hosted_client's
  send, so its timeout, its refusal of redirects and its error rules apply.

Each row keeps four fields: name, status, last seen, and the client name (client_type, or agent_framework
when client_type is empty). The session summary, task log bodies and notes are never copied into a result.

Typed states (SessionsResult.state):
- sessions: the route answered with a list. The list may be empty.
- not_running: nothing listens on the local address. Only the local source gives this state.
- missing_route: HTTP 404. Either this server has no sessions route, or the project is not on this server.
- unauthorised: HTTP 401 or 403, or no usable hosted token. The hosted request is not sent without a token.
- no_project: no project id was given. Nothing is sent.
- error: any other failure: a timeout, an unreachable server, a refused address or URL, a redirect, a body
  that is too large or is not a JSON list, or any other HTTP status.

Every message is fixed text, so a result never carries a token, a response body or a raw exception.
