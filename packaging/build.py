"""Build the MeridianDesktop ONEDIR bundle with PyInstaller, then add its licences.

ONEDIR (not onefile) keeps Qt and PySide6 as separate files so the LGPL
libraries can be replaced by the user. Qt modules this app does not use are
excluded so they are not bundled.

Steps, in order. A failed check stops the build:
1. Pin check: every licence text the build reads or ships must match its
   sha256 in packaging/licenses/SHA256SUMS, and each text must be the text it
   claims to be (LGPL, GPL, MSL).
2. PyInstaller runs with --copy-metadata for each bundled distribution, so each
   dist-info, with its licence files, is in _internal. setuptools is excluded:
   nothing the app or its direct dependencies imports it, and its vendored
   packages carry no licence files in the bundle.
3. Forbidden Qt files are pruned (packaging/lgpl_manifest.toml).
4. NOTICE.md, OFFER-SOURCE.md, EULA.txt and LICENSES/ are copied to the bundle root.
5. THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt is written at the bundle root. It has one section per
   bundled distribution (from its dist-info), one per native runtime (from
   packaging/native_runtimes.toml) and one for PyInstaller (its bootloader and
   boot module under GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Bootloader-exception, and its run-time hooks
   under Apache-2.0). Every section starts with the line "== name version (SPDX) ==".
   The build fails, naming the item, when a licence file or a version is missing,
   when a licence is GPL-only or AGPL, when a native runtime DLL in the bundle is
   not listed in native_runtimes.toml, when a bundled copy of a listed file has no
   sha256 for its path there, or when NOTICE.md does not name PyInstaller and that
   licence. A bundled copy whose bytes differ from the sha256 declared for its
   path is printed as RELEASE BLOCKED. It fails the build with --release.

Release gate: the build succeeds while EULA.txt or OFFER-SOURCE.md carries the
legal-review marker "DRAFT - NOT FOR RELEASE", and it prints a warning. With
--release the build fails instead, and it also fails while either file contains
TBD text. Counsel removes the marker after review.

Next step: python packaging/verify_bundle.py
